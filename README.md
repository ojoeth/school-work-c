# school-work-c

This is my repo with all the school work in C I have done

It's not really a project or anything, just a collection of short C programs which my school has set as schoolwork. I'm only putting it on GitHub because version control and it's in the cloud which is convenient. Feel free to open issues, although I don't know why you would want to.
